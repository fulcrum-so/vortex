## Code Contributions

The contribution process is outlined below:

1. Start a discussion by creating or commenting on a GitHub Issue (unless it's a very minor change).

2. Implement the change.
    * If the change is large, consider posting a draft pull request (PR)
      with the title prefixed with [WIP], and share with the team to get early feedback.
    * Give the PR a clear, brief description; this will be the commit message
      when the PR is merged.
    * Make sure the PR passes all CI tests.

3. Open a PR to indicate that the change is ready for review.
    * Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/spiraldb/vortex) (CLA) when prompted.
